Download the repository or clone it: First download the repository or clone it to your local computer.

Navigate to the styles directory: Within the repository, locate the styles directory where you will find all the files you need to design your website.

Select the desired style: We have provided a number of ready-made styles for you. Browse the styles directory to find the style that best suits the aesthetic of your website.

Customize with variables: One of the key features of our style kit is its flexibility. All elements can be easily customized using variables. Open the CSS file of the selected style and locate the "Variables" section. Here you can change colors, fonts, spacing and much more to adapt the style to your specific needs.

Integrate it into your website: Once you have customized the style to your liking, integrate it into your website's codebase. Paste the modified CSS file into the "head" section of your HTML document to apply the chosen style to your entire website.
